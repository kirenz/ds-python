# Data

## Data ingestion

There are various options how to store and ingest your data but we won't go into the details of data engineering in this tutorial. However, if you want to learn more about topics like:

- the basics of big data (Hadoop ecosystem and Spark),
- relational and NoSQL databases,
- how to set up a PostgreSQL and MySQL database,
- examples of different data architectures and
- components of machine learning operations (MLOps),

 review this online book:

```
<!--


### Prepare environment

In a real world data science project you would usually use a cloud environment (e.g. in Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud or Amazon AWS) to perform your data science project. However, for our course purposes, a local machine is fine.


 Here some steps to prepare your machine:

- create a new folder (e.g., `datascience`) on your machine (which is not synchronized with a cloud service like Apple's iCloud or Microsoft's OneDrive)

- open a terminal where you can use `conda` and `cd` (change directory) into your newly created folder:

```bash
cd datascience
```

- use "cookiecutter" to create a data science folder structure (see [this site](https://kirenz.github.io/python-basics/docs/programming-toolkit.html#cookiecutter-data-science) for more details). 

In your terminal:  

```bash
cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science
```

Connect your local folder with GitHub (visit [this site](https://kirenz.github.io/python-basics/docs/programming-toolkit.html#git-and-github) for more information about GitHub).

-->

### Import data

The first step is to import the data. This means that you take data stored in a file, a relational database, a NoSQL database or data lakehouse and load it into Python. In our examples, we often use [pandas to import CSV files](https://kirenz.github.io/pandas/docs/pandas-intro-short.html#read-and-write-data) and store it as `df` (short for DataFrame): 

```Python
import pandas as pd

path_to_file = "my-file.csv"

df = pd.read_csv(path_to_file)
```

### Data structure

Next, we get a first impression of the data structure: 

- Take a look at the 5 top and bottom observations of your data:

```Python
df
```

- Show the number of observations and columns:

```Python
print(f"We have {len(df.index):,} observations and {len(df.columns)} columns in our dataset.")
```

- View a description of the data, in particular the total number of rows, each attribute’s type, and the number of nonnull values:

```Python
df.info()
```

### Data corrections

Despite the fact that it would be easiest to preprocess your data right away in pandas, we only take care of the most problematic errors (like the occurence of strings in data columns or wrong data formats). We only perform absolutely necessary data preprocessing because processing your data in pandas before passing it to modules like scikit-learn might be problematic for one of the following reasons ([scikit learn developers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html#columntransformer-for-heterogeneous-data)):

- Incorporating statistics from data which later becomes our test data into the preprocessors makes cross-validation scores unreliable (known as data leakage), for example in the case of scalers (like z transformation) or imputing missing values.

- You may want to include the parameters of the preprocessors in a parameter search (for hyperparameter tuning).

Later we will see that scikit-learn's [ColumnTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html#sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer) helps performing different transformations for different columns of the data  within a data preprocessing pipeline that is safe from data leakage and that can be parametrized. To each column, a different transformation can be applied, such as preprocessing or a specific feature extraction method.

:::{Note}
As a general rule, we only take care of data errors which can be fixed without the risk of data leakage and which we don't want to include as data preprocessing steps in a pipeline. 
:::

Example of data type transformation of one variable:

```Python
df['foo'] = df['foo'].astype('float')
```

Example of data type transformation for multiple variables:

```Python
# Convert to categorical

cat_convert = ['foo1', 'foo2', 'foo3']

for i in cat_convert:
    df[i] = df[i].astype("category")
```

### Creation of new variables

During the creation of your [plan](plan.md), you maybe gained knowledge about possible ways to derive new variables from already existing columns in your dataset (e.g. through simple variable combinations). If this is the case, now would be a good time to create these variables. 

Pandas offers multiple ways to derive new columns from existing columns (see this [pandas tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/05_add_columns.html) for more examples). Note that you create a new column by assigning the output to the DataFrame with a new column name in between the `[]` and that operations are element-wise (i.e., no need to loop over rows):

```Python
df[my_new_feature] = df[feature_1] / df[feature_2]

df[my_newest_feature] = (df[feature_1] + df[feature_2])/2
```

(section:data:variable-lists)=
### Variable lists

We often need specific variables for exploratory data analysis as well as data preprocessing steps. We can use pandas to create specific lists (provided all columns are stored in the correct data format):

```python
# list of all numerical data
list_num = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()

# list of all categorical data
list_cat = df.select_dtypes(include=['category']).columns.tolist()
```

Furthermore, we prepare our data for the following processes of data splitting and building of data pipelines. Note that we use `foo` as placeholder for our outcome variable:

```python
# define outcome variable as y_label
y_label = 'foo'

# select features
features = df.drop(columns=[y_label]).columns.tolist()

# create feature data for data splitting
X = df[features]

# list of numeric features
feat_num = X.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()

# list of categorical features
feat_cat = X.select_dtypes(include=['category']).columns.tolist() 

# create response for data splitting
y = df[y_label]
```

## Data splitting

Before you start analyzing your data, it is a good idea to split your data into a *training* and *test set* {cite:p}`Geron2019`. We do this because this is the only way to know how well a model will generalize to new cases. Furthermore, we will perform exploratory data analysis only on the training data so we don't use insights from the test data during the model building process.

### Training, evaluation and test set

The error rate on new cases is called the *generalization error* (or out-of-sample error), and by evaluating our model on the test set, we get an estimate of this error. This value tells you how well your model will perform on instances it has never seen before. If the training error is low (i.e., your model makes few mistakes on the training set) but the generalization error is high, it means that your model is **overfitting** the training data.

Note that if we want to evaluate different settings (“hyperparameters”) for models, such as the [alpha in Lasso](https://kirenz.github.io/regression/docs/lasso.html), there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be tweaked until the model performs optimally ([skicit learn developers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation)). This way, knowledge about the test set can "leak" into the model and evaluation metrics no longer report on generalization performance. To solve this problem, yet another part of the dataset can be held out as a so-called “**validation set**”: training proceeds on the *training set*, after which evaluation is done on the *validation set*, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the *test set*.

Hence, you can greatly reduce your chances of overfitting by partitioning the data set into the three subsets shown in the following figure ([Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/validation/another-partition)):

<br>

```{image} ../_static/img/data-splitting.png
:alt: data-splitting
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 600px
:align: center
```
<br>

In this workflow, you pick the model that does best on the validation set and double-check that model against the test set ([Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/validation/another-partition)):

<br>

```{image} ../_static/img/splitting-workflow.png
:alt: data-splitting-workflow
:class: bg-primary mb-1
:width: 600px
:align: center
```

<br>

However, by partitioning the available data into three sets, we drastically reduce the number of samples which can be used for learning the model, and the results can depend on a particular random choice for the pair of (train, validation) sets ([skicit learn developers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html#cross-validation)). A solution to this problem is a procedure called **cross-validation** (CV for short). A test set should still be held out for final evaluation, but the validation set is no longer needed when doing CV. In the basic approach, called k-fold CV, the training set is split into k smaller sets.

### Train and test split

We typically use scikit-learn's [train test split function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) to perform data splitting and use `random_state` to make this notebook's output identical at every run (we arbitrarily set the number to 42 but you can choose any other number):

```Python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Data exploration set

We make a copy of the training data since we don’t want to alter our data during data exploration. We will use this data for our exploratory data analysis. 

We create a new DataFrame called `df_train` where we combine the training features with the corresponding y training labels:

```Python
df_train = pd.DataFrame(X_train.copy())
df_train = df_train.join(pd.DataFrame(y_train))
```

(section:data:analyze)=
## Analyze data

The goal of this phase is to understand the training data. In particular, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used to understand important predictor characteristics. Good visualisations will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data {cite:p}`Wickham2016`: A good visualisation might also hint that you’re asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Furthermore, we want to understand if there are any challenges associated with the data that can be discovered prior to modeling.  

:::{Note}
The interactive website [From Data to Viz](https://www.data-to-viz.com/) leads you to the most appropriate graph for your data.
:::

We will mainly use Pandas, Altair, Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data. To learn more about data visualization modules in Python, visit the following resources:

```{admonition} Jupyter Book
:class: tip
- [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)
- [Matplotlib and seaborn](https://kirenz.github.io/python-basics/docs/matplotlib-seaborn.html)
```

Note that in the next section, we will use lists created in [](section:data:variable-lists) for some of the steps shown below.


(section:data:categorical)=
### Categorical data

For categorical data we check the levels and their uniqueness:

```Python
df_train.describe(include="category").T 
```  

```Python
for i in list_cat:
    print(i, "\n", df_train[i].value_counts())
```  

```Python
for i in list_cat:
    print(df_train[i].value_counts().plot(kind='barh', title=i));
```  

If you have variables with many levels and are interested only in the top 10 values:

```Python
import seaborn as sns

for i in cat_list:

    TOP_10 = df[i].value_counts().iloc[:10].index

    g = sns.catplot(y=i, 
            kind="count", 
            palette="ch:.25", 
            data=df,
            order = TOP_10)    
    
    plt.title(i)
    plt.show();
```

```


### Numerical grouped by categorical

We can also investigate numerical data grouped by categorical data:

```Python
# median
for i in list_cat:
    print(df_train.groupby(i).median().round(2).T)
```

```Python
# mean
for i in list_cat:
    print(df_train.groupby(i).mean().round(2).T)
```

```Python
# standard deviation
for i in list_cat:
    print(df_train.groupby(i).std().round(2).T)
```

```{admonition} Resources
:class: tip
- [Visualization of numerical data grouped by categorical data](https://kirenz.github.io/applied-statistics/docs/eda-categorical.html#comparisons-across-groups)
```



### Numerical data

For numerical data we take a look at the central tendency and distribution:

```Python
# summary of numerical attributes
df_train.describe().round(2).T
```

```Python
# histograms
df_train.hist(figsize=(20, 15));
```

-->


### Relationships

#### Correlation with response

Detect the relationship between each predictor and the response:

```Python
sns.pairplot(data=df_train, y_vars=y_label, x_vars=features);
```

```Python
# pairplot with one categorical variable
sns.pairplot(data=df_train, y_vars=y_label, x_vars=features, hue="a_categorical_variable");
```

```Python
# inspect correlation between response and predictors
corr = df_train.corr()
corr[y_label].sort_values(ascending=False)
```

#### Correlation between predictors

Investigate relationships between predictors to detect multicollinearity:

```Python
corr = df_train.corr()
corr.style.background_gradient(cmap='Blues')
```

```Python
sns.pairplot(df_train);
```

```Python
# inspect correlations between all variables
corr = df_train.corr()
mask = np.zeros_like(corr, dtype=bool)
mask[np.triu_indices_from(mask)] = True
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(220, 10, as_cmap=True)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10)) 
sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, annot=True,  
            square=True, annot_kws={"size": 12});
```

Instead of inspecting the correlation matrix, a better way to assess multicollinearity is to compute the variance inflation factor (VIF). The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, which indicates the complete absence of collinearity. Typically in practice there is a small amount of collinearity among the predictors. As a rule of thumb, a VIF value that exceeds 5 or 10 indicates a problematic amount of collinearity.

```Python
# calculate variance inflation factor

# create new dataframe X_ and add a constant
X_ = df_train[list_num]
X_ = X_.drop(columns=y_label)
X_ = add_constant(X_)

# For each X, calculate VIF and save in dataframe
vif = pd.DataFrame()
vif["VIF Factor"] = [variance_inflation_factor(X_.values, i) for i in range(X_.shape[1])]
vif["Feature"] = X_.columns

vif.round(2)
```

An alternative way to handle multicollinear features is by performing hierarchical clustering on the Spearman rank-order correlations, picking a threshold, and keeping a single feature from each cluster (see this [scikit-learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/inspection/plot_permutation_importance_multicollinear.html#handling-multicollinear-features)).

<!--

## Define schema

Usually it is a good idea to define some sort of schema that describes the expected properties of the data. Some of these properties are ([TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started)):

- which features are expected to be present
- their type
- the number of values for a feature in each example
- the presence of each feature across all examples
- the expected domains of features.

We don't cover this topic in detail here but if you want to learn more about schemas, check out the following resources:

- [The SchemaGen TFX Pipeline Component](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/schemagen)
- [List of schema anomalies provided by TFX](https://github.com/tensorflow/data-validation/blob/master/g3doc/anomalies.md)
- [Simple solution for pandas](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54971410/how-do-you-specify-a-pandas-dataframe-schema-structure-in-a-docstring/61041468#61041468)
- [3rd party tool PandasSchema](https://multimeric.github.io/PandasSchema/)

-->

## Anomaly detection

Next, we need to identify missing values and anomalies in the data.  

Note that we just gain insights and don't perform any data preprocessing during the phase of anomaly detection. We only need to decide how to deal with the issues we detect. All data transformations will be performed during feature engineering (with pipelines).  

### Missing values

We check the degree of missingness within each predictor in the original dataframe to avoid code duplication (otherwise we first would perform all checks on `df_train` and afterwards on `df_test`).

:::{Note}
We use the original dataframe `df` to check for missing values
:::

```Python
# missing values will be displayed in yellow
sns.heatmap(df.isnull(), yticklabels=False, cbar=False, cmap='viridis');
```

```Python
# absolute number of missing values
print(df.isnull().sum())
```

```Python
# percentage of missing values
df.isnull().sum() * 100 / len(df)
```

We cover this topic in the section about [preprocessing pipelines](section:data:preprocessing-pipeline).

### Outlier and novelty detection

Many applications require being able to decide whether a new observation belongs to the same distribution as existing observations (it is an inlier), or should be considered as different (it is an outlier). Two important distinctions must be made ([scikit-learn developers](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html)):

- **outlier detection**: The training data contains outliers which are defined as observations that are far from the others. Outlier detection estimators thus try to fit the regions where the training data is the most concentrated, ignoring the deviant observations.

- **novelty detection**: The training data is not polluted by outliers and we are interested in detecting whether a new observation is an outlier. In this context an outlier is also called a novelty.

Again, we first use data exploration to gain insights about unusual cases. In addition to the plots covered in []((section:data:analyze)) (histograms are especially relevant), we can use  [boxenplots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.boxenplot.html) for our numerical data:

```Python
# boxenplots
for i in list_num:
    g=sns.boxenplot(x=df_train[i])
    plt.title(i)
    plt.show();
```

To investigate categorical data we can use the same methods as described in []( section:data:categorical).  

There are various strategies of how to deal with unusual cases which we will cover in [ preprocessing pipelines](section:data:preprocessing-pipeline). 

## Feature engineering

> "Applied machine learning is basically feature engineering" Andrew Ng 

The understanding gained in [data analysis](section:data:analyze) is now used for data preprocessing (e.g., encode categorical data, fix missing values and outliers) and feature engineering.  

Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract meaningful features (attributes) from raw data. The goal of this process is to create new features which improve the predictions from our model and my include steps like {cite:p}`Kuhn2019`:
 
- Feature transformation (transform features)
- Feature extraction (reduce the number of features by combining existing features)
- Feature creation (make new features)

Note that the usage of **data pipelines** is considered best practice to help avoid leaking statistics from your test data into the trained model during data preprocessing and feature 
engineering. Therefore, we first take a look at pipelines.

:::{Note}
The topic of **feature selection** is part of the model building process and will be covered in the [modeling phase](https://kirenz.github.io/ds-python/docs/model.html#feature-selection).
:::

(section:data:pipeline)=
### Pipelines

scikit-learn provides a library of transformers for data preprocessing and feature engineering. 

 ```{admonition} Pipelines 
:class: tip
- scikit-learn's [pipelines documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/compose.html)
```

### Feature transformation

Typically, we need to perform feature transformations because predictors may {cite:p}`Kuhn2019`:

- have missing values
- contain a small number of extreme values (outliers)
- be on vastly different scales
- need to be numeric instead of categorical
- follow a skewed distribution where a small proportion of samples are orders of magnitude larger than the majority of the data (i.e., skewness).
- be censored on the low and/or high end of the range.


#### Fix missing values

If we find missing cases in our data, we need to decide how to deal with them. For example, we could:

1. Get rid of the corresponding observations.
1. Get rid of the whole attribute.
1. Impute with some other value (zero, the mean, the median, etc.).

We will include a [imputation of missing values](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html) in our pipeline.

(section:data:fix-outliers)=

#### Fix outliers

There are various options of how to fix outliers and scikit-learn provides a set of machine learning tools that can be used both for novelty or outlier detection. For a comparison of outlier detection algorithms in scikit-learn, review [this site](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/outlier_detection.html#overview-of-outlier-detection-methods).

For example, one efficient way of performing outlier detection in high-dimensional datasets is to use the random forest algorithm [IsolationForest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html#sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest) (this algorithm can't be included in a pipline). When we perform fit on our variable, it returns labels for it: -1 for outliers and 1 for inliers.

```Python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

list_detect = df_train.drop(y_label).columns.tolist()

clf = IsolationForest(random_state=42)

clf.fit(X_train[list_detect])
y_pred_train = clf.predict(X_train[list_detect])
y_pred_test = clf.predict(X_test[list_detect])
```

An alternative and more simple approach to handle outliers would be the usage of robust scalers for numeric data, which can be included in a pipline (see [robust scaling](data:scaling:robustscaling).


(section:data:scaling)=
#### Feature scaling

Feature scaling is a method used to change raw feature vectors into a representation that is more suitable for learning algorithms. 

:::{Note}
Scaling the target values is generally not required.
:::

##### Types

Most learning algorithms benefit from standardization (normalization) of the data set since they don’t perform well when the input numerical attributes have very different scales (think of different measurment units like cm and m). For instance, many elements used in the objective function of a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector Machines or the l1 and l2 regularizers of linear models) assume that all features are centered around zero and have variance in the same order (an exception are decision tree-based estimators since they are robust to arbitrary scaling of the data).

In general, **standardization** uses linear transformers (scalers) which differ from each other in the way they estimate the parameters used to shift and scale each feature. 

Scikit-learn also offers [`QuantileTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.QuantileTransformer.html#sklearn.preprocessing.QuantileTransformer) which provides non-linear transformations in which distances between marginal outliers and inliers are shrunk. Furthermore, [`PowerTransformer`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer.html#sklearn.preprocessing.PowerTransformer) provides non-linear transformations in which data is mapped to a normal distribution to stabilize variance and minimize skewness.

Unlike the previous methods, **normalization** refers to a per sample transformation instead of a per feature transformation.

##### StandardScaler

In our projects, we usually use **standardization** to scale our features: Standardization centers the data by removing the mean value of each feature, then scale it by dividing features by their standard deviation. This leads to a standard normally Gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit variance.

Scikit-learn provides a transformer called [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html) for this:

```Python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
```

Note that `StandardScaler` cannot guarantee balanced feature scales in the presence of outliers.

(data:scaling:robustscaling)=
##### RobustScaler

If outliers are present in the data set, **robust scalers** are more appropriate then standard scaler. This Scaler removes the median and scales the data according to the quantile range (defaults to IQR: Interquartile Range). The IQR is the range between the 1st quartile (25th quantile) and the 3rd quartile (75th quantile): [RobustScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html#sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler).

```Python
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

scaler = RobustScaler()
```

##### MinMaxScaler

An alternative to standardization is **Min-max scaling**, also called **normalization**. Here, values are shifted and rescaled so that they end up ranging from 0 to 1 (e.g., neural networks often expect an input value ranging from 0 to 1). We do this by subtracting the min value and dividing by the max minus the min. Scikit-Learn provides a transformer called [MinMaxScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this. It has a feature_range hyperparameter that lets you change the range if, for some reason, you don’t want 0–1.

```Python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
```

Note that `MinMaxScaler` is very sensitive to the presence of outliers.

#### Encode categorical features

Usually algorithms prefer to work with numbers, so we need to convert categorial variables from text to numbers. 

*Scikit-learn* provides a [OneHotEncoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html) class to convert categorical values into one-hot vectors (one-hot encoding) which we will use in our data preprocessing pipeline.

*Pandas* also has a function to convert categorical variable into dummy/indicator variables: [pandas.get_dummies](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.get_dummies.html)

### Feature extraction

Features may contain relevant but overly redundant information. That is, the information collected could be more effectively and efficiently represented with a smaller, consolidated number of new predictors while still preserving or enhancing the new predictors’ relationship with the response {cite:p}`Kuhn2019`. In that case, feature extraction can be achieved by simply using the ratio of two predictors or with the help of more complex methods like pricipal component analysis.

If your number of features is high, it may be useful to reduce it with an unsupervised step prior to supervised steps. You can reduce features with different [unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/unsupervised_reduction.html#data-reduction) in scikit-learn.

### Custom feature operations

Although scikit-Learn provides many useful transformers, eventually you may need to write your own functions for tasks such as custom data cleaning procedures or feature engineering (like creating new features). 

If you want your transformer to work with scikit-Learn functionalities (such as pipelines), all you need to do is create a class and implement three methods: 

- `fit()` (returning self), 
- `transform()`, and 
- `fit_transform()`.

You find a code template to build your own functions [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/project-template/blob/master/skltemplate/_template.py) (see `class TemplateTransformer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator)`). 

Note that you get the `fit_transform` automatically by simply adding `TransformerMixin` as a base class. If you add `BaseEstimator` as a base class (and avoid args and kargs in your constructor), you will also get the two extra methods [get_params() and set_params()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/develop.html#get-params-and-set-params) that will be useful for automatic hyperparameter tuning.

(section:data:final-pipeline)=
### Final data pipeline

In this final step, we will build a typical data preprocessing pipeline using some of the functions covered in the previous sections. 

:::{Note}
We use features created in [](section:data:variable-lists) for some of the steps shown below
:::

    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='missing')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
    ])

# create full pipeline
full_pipeline = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', num_pipeline, feat_num),
        ('cat', cat_pipeline, feat_cat)])


```

In the following model building phase (see [](model.md)), section "Train and evaluate", we can easily combine our full pipline with scikit-learn algorithms.
